# MemoryDungeon

**MemoryDungeon** expands upon the traditional memory game by incorporating elements of roleplay, roguelike gameplay, and a PvE experience.

It is originally designed by Tonis and I using [C/C++ Windows Forms](./C/), as a mini-project for course ENG2002 at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

It is now redesigned using [Qt](./Qt/).

The current codebase in this repository provides a reference for the [rule](./rule.pdf) of the game, and also a [demo](./Demo/Qt/).
