# MemoryDungeon

**MemoryDungeon** is a game I made with Tonis as the mini-project for course ENG2002 at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

It is originally based on C/C++.

The current codebase in this repository just intends to provide a reference for the [rule](./rule.pdf) of the game, and also a [demo](./Demo-C/).

**DISCLAMER: All the resources used in the game are found online and we do not own the copyright(s). The game is for teaching purpose (as a course project) and it is not intended for making any profits.**
